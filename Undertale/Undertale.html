    <h2>What is the Outcome of Your Actions?</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      The Pacifist Route involves taking action in a way that doesn't harm any character you encounter. This means that there is no killing involved in the gameplay.<br>
      The Genocide Route involves killing every character you encounter in battle.<br>
      The Neutral Route involves a mix of both. You can essentially play both routes in one, by sparing some monsters,<br> and killing others.<br><br>
      If you start your gameplay with genocide, your actions will be remembered throughout, as well as into the next time you start the game. Characters will remember what actions you had taken during previous playthroughs.<br>
      The same can be said for the other routes you choose.<br><br>

    <button class="collapsible">The Ruins</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>You fell down and woke up in a flowerbed, where you encountered a flower that wanted to "teach you the rules of the monster world". You were then rescued by Toriel, who decided to guide you through The Ruins to a point where she believed you were independent enough to get through the ruins on your own.</p>
    </div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Toriel's Home</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You managed to make your way through the ruins, reaching a cute litle house. From behind a bare tree outside the house, Toriel emerged, surprised to see you standing there in front of her. You both entered her house, where she implied that you would live there; that that was your new home. Desperate to go home, you refused to stay there, and fought for your chance to exit the ruins, which led you to a new location: an icy forest.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Snowdin Forest</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You exited the ruins, and entered a forest covered in ice. You kept walking, until you came to a barrier. Someone came behind you and made you turn around to "greet" them. They said their name was Sans. He told you to go through the little gate, because it was too wide to stop anyone. There, you were met with Papyrus, the rather eccentric brother of Sans. You were faced with many puzzles and challenges, which eventually brought you to the town of Snowdin.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">The Town of Snowdin</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You entered a town called Snowdin. There, you met a variety of monsters, who seemed almost content with their living situations, despite being forced to live udnerground by humans. They were rather friendly folk. You eventually came to a bridge, where you saw Papyrus. You fought, and he declared you as a friend and did not want to continue fighting. He wished you luck on your journey to The Core.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Waterfall</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You went on your way past that bridge, and keep going through. You come across a literal waterfall. You heard someone coming, so you hid in a large patch of grass. Above you, you could see Papyrus and a figure in chainmail. That was Undyne, the Head of the Royal Guard. Papyrus was there to give some kind of report, you guessed. After Papyrus left, Undyne turned, and seemed to see you. She made a move to attack, but didn't. You then got out from the grass, and met Monster Kid, who you had encountered in Snowdin. He mentioned how epic it was that Undyne was looking at you with such hatred, and wondered what you did to harbour that reaction from her. You keep going, and come across a little area, with a lot of running water. In the water, you could see four flower seeds. The sign stated that you could make a bridge with them, so you did. You set them up vertically at the top, and created a flower bridge. Once you crossed it, Papyrus called you, and asked what you were wearing. He wanted to know because he told his friend [Undyne] that you were wearing something specific, and wanted to make sure you WEREN'T wearing that, so he thought you would be safe. After exiting that room, you came across a room with a telescope. So you decided to look through. It showed that there was something on the wall. So you checked it out, and found a door! You eventually came across a jetty, where you had to step onto a panel to get taken across to the next section.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Undyne Fight Part 1</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Once you crossed the section, you came across a little path. Suddenly, a spear was thrown in your direction. Undyne came into view, and you were suddenly surrounded by multiple spears sticking up from the bottom of the path. You ran once you had the chance, and the spears kept popping up from the ground. Each time you came in contact with one, you were forced into battle with Undyne, who would throw spears at you non-stop. Eventually, you turned around to face her, and you fell through the path.</p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Garbage Dumps</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You could hear someone talking to you, learning your name. But before you could hear their name, you awoke on a bed of flowers. You kept heading east, and found a cooler with a space bar, so you decided to stash it. You headed north, where you saw a practice dummy, like the one you used to practice with Toriel. You ignored it, and went on your way. But the dummy moved to block your path! It was a ghost! You entered a fight with the dummy. But since it was a ghost inside the dummy, you couldn't do any physical damage. Eventually, you were saved by Napstablook, a ghost you encountered in The Ruins. He invited you over to his house, which was up ahead. You went there. The house next door was locked, and you weren't able to enter. After some time there, you went on your way. There was a pathway west, so you went through it. Through a door, you saw an old turtle selling weapons and armour. He told you about the history of monsters, as well as the meaning of the Deltarune, the symbol of the royal family. Then he warned you to be careful on your path. You then went back where you came, and went east. You then came across a narrow path, where you could light up with mushroom lamps on the sides. After that, you kept heading east, where you went on a similar but longer path. You could light this path with street lamps rather than mushrooms. However, the light didn't last long enough, and you had to keep using the street lamps every few seconds or so. You kept going, and eventually came across an echo flower that repeated the last thing it heard back to you.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Undyne Fight Part 2 | Undyne's House</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You were met with Undyne once again, however Monster Kid came between the two of you, saving you from a battle with her for the moment. Monster Kid slipped off the path, and you decided to save him. You then went along your way after the two of them left. Eventually, you came across a mountain, where there was a save point. You then saw Undyne above, and she challenged you to an incredibly difficult fight sequence. You kept fleeing from the battle so you wouldn't die fighting her. Papyrus called you during the fight, which was lucky because she didn't attack you during the call. You then came across the bridge between Waterfall and Hotland, and Undyne collapsed due to the heat. You found a water dispenser, and poured some water on her, and she got up, looked at you, then walked away. You decided to head the way she left, east. Then you eventually came across a ferry, and you got on it, and headed to Waterfall. You went along the path, and saw a fishhead-shaped house. You decided this must be Undyne's home. You saw Papyrus was standing in front of the door. He asked you to hang out, and you said yes. Then, you went inside. He gave Undyne a bone as a gift, and she kept it in the bone drawer, with the other bone gifts. Eventually, Papyrus broke through the window, stating he had to use the washroom, which left you and Undyne standing in her home awkwardly. She mocked you and wondered if you were there to gloat your victory, or 'befriend' her. Eventually, she agreed to be friends, and had you sit at her table, and asked you what you wanted to drink. The only option allowed was tea, so that was what you chose. She decided to teach you to cook spaghetti, and eventually burned her house. She then challenged you to a duel, and you faked a hit, not wanting to actually hurt her. She also didn't want to hurt you. So the two of you became friends. Eventually, you left, and took the ferry to move forward in your journey.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Hotland Part 1</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You took the ferry to "Hotland". You kept heading east, and found a building called "Lab". You went inside.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">The Lab</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You entered the lab. The place was a bit dark to be able to see properly. However, you soon noticed a screen showing you. Curious, you kept going. You came face to face with Dr. Alphys, the head royal scientist. She awkwardly explained she had been keeping tabs on you, and expressed interest in wanting to help you in your journey. She stated she had made a robot to help around with stuff. And as soon as that conversation started, a robot burst through the walls of the lab. It starts a quiz show type of battle with you, and Dr. Alphys guided you through it, showing you what you had to answer with. After the "battle", Mettaton, as you came to know as the robot's name, left. Dr. ALphys then upgraded your phone to be able to send texts, store your items, and access the monster social networks. She kept updating her status, and you got the notification each time that happened. You eventually exited the lab.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Hotland Part 2</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The path was pretty linear for a while. You came across conveyor belts, which you had to step on in order to move to the other paths. Dr. Alphys called you and explained the mechanisms of the puzzles. For example, the blue lazers zap if you move, and the orange ones zap if you stay in one spot. At the other end, there was a switch. You pressed it, and it deactivated the lazers, so you could go back if needed. She called you many times to explain the puzzles as you moved forward.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Mettaton</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You came across, and found yourself in a dark room. Dr. Alphys hacked into the system, and turned the lights on. You found yourself in a cooking show type of area with Mettaton as the host. This was after all, his show. You gathered the ingredients to bake a cake. Eventually, you had to wear a jetpack to reach an ingredient too high for you to get. Mettaton eventually left, and you were able to move forward. You kept on following the path West. Eventually, you came across two armoured guards standing beside each other. They eventually confessed their feelings for each other after you battle them. Then, they left to get some ice cream together. You continued forward, and into a dark room, where Dr. Alphys turned the lights on again. You found yourself in another segment of Mettaton's show. Eventually, you beat the game and Mettaton left once again.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Muffet's Lair</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You kept moving forward, and came across an elevator. You went to the Third Floor. You encounted another Spider Bake Sale. You moved on, and came across more puzzles, which you were able to solve. Eventually, you came across the spider corridor. You went through it, and got trapped in spider webbing. Muffet had trapped you. You went into battle with her, and chose to eat the spider treats you had bought in The Ruins. She then accused you of stealing them. Then a messenger spider came, and informed her that you were kind enough to buy it from the Bake Sale in The Ruins. After hearing that, Muffet let you go, and the battle stopped.
    </p></div></div><br>


    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">MTT Resort, Mettaton, and the Core</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You moved forward, and were met once again with Mettaton, who sang a song about you dying and falling down into a dungeon. Mettaton hit a switch, and you fell into some sort of basement or dungeon. You came across the tile puzzle you went through in Snowdin, and Dr. Alphys saved you. Then, you went into battle with Mettaton once more. You decided to press the switch on Mettaton's back, which Dr. Alphys suggested. This led to Mettaton transforming into his new and improved form. The battle continued, until he got calls from viewers, and became so overwhelmed with their love, he stopped the battle. You went forward, and found the entrance to MTT Resort, and saw Sans standing at the doorway. He invited you for a meal, and you agreed. You had an interesting conversation with him. He stated that he found a door one day during his sentry duties, and checked it out. He was able to talk to a lady on the other side of the door. They shared jokes and nice conversation. One day, the lady made Sans promise to take care of any human that went through, and not harm them. He then stated that had he not made that promise, you would have been dead on the spot. Then the conversation went back to normal, and was less scary. You exit the restaurant, and found yourself in the resort. You went through the resort, completing little quests for others and encountering a vendor selling wares.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">Home of Asgore, the Last Corridor, and the Barrier</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You eventually made your way out of the resort. You went through a long grey corridor, leading into a grey home. It reminded you of Toriel's home, only less colourful, and more empty. You passed by a familiar area in the house, the set of stairs going down into a basement. Only now, it had a padlock. The note by it said to retrieve the keys for it. You found a green key in the kitchen, and another in a bedroom, similar to the one you slept in in Toriel's house. You then unlocked the padlock, and went into the basement. You kept on encountering monsters along the way. They all spoke the story of how the royal family had taken in a human child who had fallen down, and more of the story. You eventually found yourself going down a long hall. In the hall, you found Sans. He was there to judge you, depending on what actions you had taken previously. Since you had not killed any monster before, he admired your compassion, and let you go forth, wishing you luck. You kept moving forward. You found a room filled with seven coffins. They were of the previous humans who had lost their lives down here. Eventually, you reached a kind of throne room surrounded by yellow flowers. It was like a garden. A large figure stood at the back, facing the opposite direction of you. This was Asgore, the King of Monsters. He didn't want to fight you, but felt like he had to for his people. Thus, you entered a battle with Asgore. He defeated you many times, killing you. But you kept going back. Reminding him of how many times he had killed you seemed to sadden him, and weaken his defences. Eventually, you were so low on health, you brought out the Butterscotch and Cinnamon pie Toriel had baked for you earlier. This brought out an emotional reaction from Asgore. Eventually, he stopped wanting to fight. You spared him. However, as he was speaking, he was struck dead. Flowey the yellow flower entered the scene. He claimed six of the human souls, and you both fought. You fought with all you had. Flowey kept striking until you were nearly dead. Then, the souls stepped in. You had a chance to either kill or spare Flowey. You chose to spare him, and eventually he fled. You thought your journey had come to an end, but there was more.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">True Lab</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You were able to escape as well. You weren't sure where exactly you were. Sans called you, and updated you on what was going on. You were able to speak to Papyrus, Undyne, and even Toriel. Flowey then shows up, asking why you spared him, not understanding. He eventually tells you to go visit Dr. Alphys and see what she was up to. You found yourself back to where you were before you fought with Asgore. Undyne called, and asked you to do a favour for her. You went back to Snowdin, and found Undyne and Papyrus standing outside Sans and Papyrus' house. She handed you a secret letter to give to Dr. Alphys, and made you promise not to open it. Though tempted, you did not. You took the ferry to Hotland, and found the lab. You slid it under the door. Dr. Alphys came out, thinking the letter was from you. She then started a date with you, not knowing it was from Undyne. Eventually, you got her to confess her feelings for Undyne. Just then, Undyne came by. She sent Dr. Alphys off with Papyrus to work on her confidence. You found yourself at the Waterfall garbage dump. So you took the ferry to Hotland, and entered the lab. You found a note, and decided to follow with what that note said. You took an elevator down to the basement. You found yourself in a dark corridor. You went forth, through the darkness. You found notes along the wall, so you read them as you went along. You found out about some interesting experiments Dr. Alphys had been doing with Determination, and how she had somehow managed to merge multiple monsters together into one; multiple times. You encountered those "monsters". You found a room with beds, and lay down on one. A creature appeared above your head, and tucked you in. Eventually, all kinds of these merged monsters came after you, and Dr. Alphys stepped in between. She admitted that they were probably hungry, and that she wanted to come clean about all of it. You went back inside the elevator, and you received a phone call. You found yourself back in the grey house somehow. You went through, and found Asgore. You were about to battle, when Toriel stepped in, scolding him. Dr. Alphys, Undyne, Sans, and Papyrus were also there. Again, it seemed like it was over. Once again, Flowey showed up. This time, he captured everyone else. He revealed himself to be Asriel, the supposedly dead son of Toriel and Asgore. The two of you began a battle. He eventually transformed into a winged creature, saying he hadn't been using his full power at the time. Each time it seemed like you were dead, you kept pulling yourself together and fighting again and again and again. Eventually, Asriel is defeated, and he turns into a small child, like he was before all this happened, and before he died. You forgave him for everything, and consoled him. You awoke, and found yourself surrounded by your friends. You decided to go through the barrier together, as Asriel had shattered it. You decided to go all the way back, talking to all the monsters you encounted along the way. They were so happy about being free. They thanked you. You went all the way back to the flower bed where you awoke the first time, and saw Asriel tending to the flowers. You asked him if he wanted to join you on the way out, he decided that it would be too painful for his parents that way. He stayed behind.
    </p></div></div><br>

    <div class="location">
    <button class="collapsible">The Surface</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You and all your friends made your way through the barrier, and found yourself on top of the mountain. You could see the sunlight bursting through the clouds. You were free at last.

    <h2>What Are the Fighting Mechanics When You Encounter an Attack?</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      When you encounter a monster, an exclamation mark will pop up, and you would go into battle with them. There are many options to choose from. You can FIGHT, which means you'll be able to attack the monster, and maybe even kill them. You can ACT. There are actions you can take that are particular to a specific monster. Or you can SPARE, which is when a monster doesn't want to fight anymore. You can show them MERCY, and leave them be.
